We're building Marble with that same mindset: a simple, powerful platform for people who want to 
create blogs or build content-driven tools and actually enjoy the process.

## So what is Marble?

Marble is a lightweight Headless CMS that keeps things simple, so you can focus on writing great content and building your site without the fuss. 
Whether you’re drafting your first post or developing a modular content solution, Marble helps you go from idea to execution in minutes with a clean editor, sensible defaults, and tools that just work.
